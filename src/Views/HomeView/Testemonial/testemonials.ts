    text: `" Yordan is a fantastic individual, as he has such a positive mindset with everything he does.
      He is someone who delivered great work on the projects he was assigned at DCSL Guidesmiths and in some instances it meant learning new concepts/technologies, 
      which he managed to do with ease. He's a strong communicator and a great team player. He will be sorely missed at the company and 
      I sincerely hope that our paths cross again in the future! Thanks for everything Yordan! "`,

    text: `As Head of Marketing at Sport Stream Ltd, I worked closely with Yordan for several months. Yordan was a fundamental influence on the development of our website's 
      front-end and initial functionality. Having been given a heavy workload, constantly adjusting designs and concepts, Yordan remained diligent and was a reliable and flexible member of staff. 
      All here at Sport Stream were sad to see Yordan move on and progress in to a role elsewhere. However, his hard work and extensive skill set have left a really positive mark on our company, 
      of which we feel very grateful.`,

     I highly recommend working with Yordan. During our few months of projects, the communication was perfect. Yordan 
      fulfilled every task and was eager to learn and gain new skills. I especially think that Yordan's 
      level of social communication is at the top level. I think he will find himself in every community and culture :)"`,
